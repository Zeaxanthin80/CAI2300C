        "You start an e-commerce site to sell  electronics. A customer is searching for a \"4K TV.\"  Traditional keyword search might only return TV's explicitly described with those exact words. However, semantic search can understand the meaning behind the query.  It will return TV's that are described as \"4K,\" \"OLED,\" or even \"curved tv's,\" even if those terms weren't directly used in the search.  Furthermore, it can prioritize tv's with reviews mentioning \"visual perfection\" or \"immersive experience,\" even if those words aren't in the product description itself.  This leads to more relevant search results and a better customer experience, increasing the likelihood of a purchase."
