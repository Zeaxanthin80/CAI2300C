## 🚀 Getting Started  

To set up this repository on your machine, run the following commands in your terminal:  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zeaxanthin80/CAI2300C.git
```
### 2️⃣ Navigate to the repository
```sh
cd CAI2300C_NLP
```
### 3️⃣ Install the required dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

## 📝 Notes
Each week's folder contains the respective Jupyter Notebook and any associated resources.
Some notebooks may require additional dependencies. Install them using
```sh
# If using a virtual enviroment, skip this step to the next section below.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Virtual Environment 
For easier dependency management, consider creating a virtual environment. You can do this with:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
Then, install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📦 Large datasets are not included in the repository. 
You can download them from the course materials or specified sources.

### Colab Link
To add the colab link so that it appears at the top of the notebook in the GitHub code preview page, copy the following code and paste it to the top of the raw colab file.
```sh
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "metadata": {
        "id": "view-in-github",
        "colab_type": "text"
      },
      "source": [
        "<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/<USER_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>/blob/main/<FILE_NAME>.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\" width=\"2em\" height=\"auto\"/></a>"
      ]
    },
```
