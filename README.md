## 🚀 Getting Started  

To set up this repository on your machine, run the following commands in your terminal:  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zeaxanthin80/CAI2300C.git
```
### 2️⃣ Navigate to the repository
```sh
cd CAI2300C_NLP
```
### 3️⃣ Install the required dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

## 📝 Notes
Each week's folder contains the respective Jupyter Notebook and any associated resources.
Some notebooks may require additional dependencies. Install them using
```sh
# If using a virtual enviroment, skip this step to the next section below.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Virtual Environment 
For easier dependency management, consider creating a virtual environment. You can do this with:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
Then, install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📦 Large datasets are not included in the repository.
